# QUBO Sampler

The program converts Q-matrix data of a QUBO-model into COO-format. The implemented sampling method ’sample_qubo’ by D-Wave System is invoked. The solution output is written to a text file for further processing and analysis.
Background:
A problem from number theory is expressed as a QUBO-model. The used set of binary variables represents a tensor product of two equally sized binary vectors.
